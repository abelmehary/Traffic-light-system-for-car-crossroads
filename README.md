Working of Arduino Traffic Light Controller

This project is done to give an idea of how the traffic light controller works. At the start, green light of signal 1 and red lights at other signals will light up to give time to the vehicles at signal 1 to pass. After 9 seconds, the yellow light at signal 1 will light up to give an indication that the red light at signal 1 is about to come up and also to give an indication to the vehicles at signal 2 that the green light is about to light up. So after 3 seconds, red light at signal 1 will come up and green light at signal 2 will come up meaning vehicles at signal 1 must stop and vehicles at signal 2 can move. Similarly the traffic light controller will work for the signal 3, signal 4 and the system will keep looping.
Components Required for Arduino Traffic Light Controller
The components required for Arduino traffic light controller are as follows
o	Arduino UNO
o	Red LED’s (4 pieces)
o	Yellow LED’s (4 pieces)
o	Green LED’s (4 pieces)
o	220 ohm resistors (12 pieces)
o	Jumper cables
o	Breadboards
Circuit Diagram for Arduino Traffic Light Controller

There are total of 12 LED’s used in this project. Each signal has 3 LED’s (Red, Yellow and Green) connected to it through the 220 ohm resistors. The resistors are used to limit the current that is going to pass through the LED’s. If you won’t use the resistors then the LED’s may burn.
